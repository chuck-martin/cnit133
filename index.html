<p>And heeeere's my class project, a <a href="project/project.html">Blackjack game!</a></p>
<p>My final project, while working almost flawlessly, was not feature complete. (Which, as I understand it, is the point of "agile," to get something out there quickly and then finish it later.) So I'm continuing to work on completing the <a href="project_continued/project_set.html">Blackjack game take 2</a> (which may or may not function when you look at it depending on the state of its code). Besides trying to "object-ify" more of the code, this version is using a set to represent a deck of card, rather than an array.</p>
<p>To cap everything, the final exam. The instrucitons are in <a href="final/Final_Project_CNIT_133_Cards.pdf">this PDF</a>. And I was able to take some of the work I did for the class project and incorporate it into <a href="final/chuck_martin_final.html">the code I wrote</a>.</p>
